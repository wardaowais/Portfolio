                <p>My name is Warda Owais, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree from Jinnah University for Women. My career in this field began with my curiosity about how mobile applications work and who develops them. Over time, I realized that there are developers behind these applications, which inspired me to pursue this field.</p>
                <p>As I advanced in my studies, I developed a deep interest in technology and innovation. I believe we can create new things and bring about change in the IT industry with minimal investment, simply by using our time and focus effectively. During my first semester, I learned Python and recognized the growing importance of AI. I am now eager to contribute to the AI field and tackle its challenges.</p>
                <p>While I enjoy being a front-end developer, my dreams stretch far beyond. I see myself as a full-stack developer, mastering both the front-end and back-end of websites. This path means continuous learning and diving deeper into the world of software development, exploring backend programming, testing, debugging, hosting, and managing domains. It's a challenging journey, but one I'm excited to embark on to become a truly well-rounded software engineer.</p>
                <p>Once I've gained more experience in full-stack web development, I'll start learning about Android app development. Then, I'll explore software development, followed by learning about testing, debugging, hosting, domains, and other programming languages. This is my roadmap to becoming a successful software engineer.</p>
                <p>I am confident in my ability to master programming languages and embrace new technologies within the dynamic IT landscape. This is just the beginning of my journey. With each milestone, I grow closer to my ultimate goal of becoming a full-stack developer and contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving world of software engineering.</p>
                <p>This portfolio is hosted on GitHub Pages, which means it's a static website. While updates can be made as needed. If you'd like to see my GitHub profile, click the "Home" tab in the top left corner.</p>
                <p>Thank you for reading about myself and my journey. I look forward to sharing more about my future endeavors.</p>
